# Implement Row Level Security (RLS) in PostgreSQL

As per the requirements, we will implement Row Level Security (RLS) in PostgreSQL to ensure that users can only access their own data. This involves creating policies that restrict access based on the user ID.

---

For your current single-user scenario:

- Not having RLS enabled is acceptable if you're the only user accessing the database through a single database user
- This works fine for development or simple applications where you don't need row-level permissions
- For your future multi-user implementation:

Your approach is exactly right - you'll want to:
1. Add a user_id column to each table that needs access control
2. Enable RLS on those tables
3. Create policies that check the user_id against your application-set context
The policy you referenced is the correct approach:

```sql
-- When you're ready to implement multi-user access:

-- 1. First add user_id column to your tables (if not already present)
ALTER TABLE public.bok ADD COLUMN app_user_id UUID NOT NULL;

-- 2. Enable RLS on the table
ALTER TABLE public.bok ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 3. Create policies for different operations
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own data"
ON public.bok
FOR SELECT
USING (app_user_id = current_setting('app.user_id', true));

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own data"
ON public.bok
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (app_user_id = current_setting('app.user_id', true));

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own data"
ON public.bok
FOR UPDATE
USING (app_user_id = current_setting('app.user_id', true))
WITH CHECK (app_user_id = current_setting('app.user_id', true));

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own data"
ON public.bok
FOR DELETE
USING (app_user_id = current_setting('app.user_id', true));
```

This is a solid approach for application-managed authentication. When you implement this:

1. Your application will authenticate users through your chosen method
2. Before running database operations, you'll set the context variable:

```sql
SET LOCAL app.user_id = 'user-uuid-here';
```

3. Then all subsequent queries will be filtered by the RLS policies
This gives you the flexibility to implement authentication however you want while still leveraging PostgreSQL's powerful RLS system for data security.
