# Frontend (React + TypeScript) Design Standards

Design principles for frontend architecture.

## Component Design
- Compound Components: Compose small, reusable parts.
- Hooks: Custom hooks for logic reuse (e.g., useFetch).

## FP Patterns
- Memoization: Use React.memo and useMemo for performance.
- Composition: Higher-order components or render props.

## Architecture
- Layering: Separate concerns (UI, logic, data fetching).
- State: Global with Redux (immutable reducers); local with useState/useReducer.

## Common Patterns
- Error Boundaries: For robust handling.
- Routing: Use react-router with lazy loading.

Modify with squad patterns.
