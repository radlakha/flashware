# AI Workflow Reflection
This document outlines the structured approach to integrating AI tools into our engineering workflows, focusing on breaking down user stories into manageable tasks while leveraging project context. The goal is to enhance productivity, reduce AI hallucinations, and align with Scrum practices.
## Why We Are Doing It
Engineers face hit-or-miss AI outputs, leading to stress from unmet productivity expectations despite access to Gemini and Copilot. We're creating a structured flow to deliver reliable, high-quality AI assistance for significant gains.

## What Is the Approach
Build iterative, modular workflows: Organize standards/context in folders (e.g., squad-canary-standards, project-canary-context), use templated prompts for story breakdowns into tasks, refine manually, and integrate with Scrum practices like retros.

## How Will This Approach Help
Upfront setup (files, instructions) minimizes AI hallucinations and overload, turning random attempts into predictable collaborationâ€”reducing frustration, boosting consistency, and unlocking time savings through focused AI use in planning/coding.

## What Metrics We Will Track
- **AI Hit Rate**: % of AI outputs needing <2 iterations (tracked via squad logs).
- **Time Saved per Story**: Before/after hours from story to PR (target: 20-30% reduction).
- **How Often We Are Shipping to Prod**: Deployment frequency per sprint (e.g., via Vercel logs; aim for increase).
- **Surveys/Retros**: Team ratings (1-10) on AI reliability/frustration (weekly feedback).
- **Adoption Rate**: % of stories using the process (via commit checks; target >70%).
